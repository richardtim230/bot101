    <h2>Physical and Chemical Nature of Genetic Material: Unveiling the Secrets of Heredity</h2>

      <p>Good morning once again, my wonderful students! Today, we are taking a deep dive into the very essence of heredity, the genetic material. We're not just talking about abstract concepts; we're going to explore what this genetic material *actually is* physically and chemically. *E no be juju o*, but it's very powerful!</p>

      <h3>What is Genetic Material?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Blueprint of Life:</strong>
          <p>Genetic material is the substance that carries the instructions for building and maintaining a living organism. It's like the master plan that tells the cell what to do. This material is passed from parent to offspring, ensuring the continuity of traits, *abi no be so*? Think of it like the family recipe that’s passed down from *mama* to daughter, making the *moi moi* taste just the same.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Criteria for Genetic Material:</strong>
            <p>For a substance to qualify as the genetic material, it needs to fulfill some important criteria:
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Information storage:</strong> It must be able to store vast amounts of information necessary to build an organism.</li>
                  <li><strong>Replication:</strong> It must be able to be accurately copied and passed on to new cells during cell division.</li>
                  <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> It must be reliably passed from parent to offspring through reproduction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Variation:</strong> It must be capable of undergoing change, to allow for variations and evolution, or *things no go progress*.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physical Nature of Genetic Material</h3>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Chromosomes:</strong>
             <p>In eukaryotic cells, genetic material is organized into structures called chromosomes, located within the nucleus. It's like organizing your market goods into labelled baskets so that you know where everything is. In prokaryotes, the genetic material is usually a single circular chromosome located in the cytoplasm. The chromosomes consist of DNA, and proteins.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>DNA Structure:</strong>

            <p>The primary component of chromosomes is DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a double helix structure, like a twisted ladder. *Na dis one be the real deal o*! The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases. The shape is important for how it replicates and works.</p>
            <p>* Historical Note: Remember the names of Watson and Crick, who described the structure of DNA using the research of others such as Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This discovery changed the course of Biology*</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Packaging of DNA:</strong>
            <p>The DNA in a chromosome is very long, so it's tightly coiled and packed with the help of proteins, called histones, into compact structures. *E just like rope wey person fold well so it doesn’t scatter everywhere*. This packaging is important to enable DNA to fit into the small space of the nucleus.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>

       <h3>Chemical Nature of Genetic Material</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DNA Composition:</strong>
            <p>DNA is a polymer made up of smaller units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains three parts:
              <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deoxyribose Sugar:</strong> This is a 5-carbon sugar molecule, *e sweet small small* (in a scientific way *o*).</li>
                    <li><strong>Phosphate Group:</strong> This group is responsible for the negative charge of DNA.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrogenous Base:</strong> There are four different bases:
                         <ul>
                           <li>Adenine (A)</li>
                           <li>Guanine (G)</li>
                           <li>Cytosine (C)</li>
                           <li>Thymine (T)</li>
                          </ul>
                       A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G, *dem be best friends forever*.
                  </li>
              </ul>
             </p>
         </li>
         <li><strong>The Double Helix and Complementary Base Pairing:</strong>
             <p>The two strands of DNA are complementary – the sequence of bases on one strand dictates the sequence on the other. This is due to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G). This base pairing makes it easy for DNA to replicate itself. It’s like using a perfect mold to produce identical copies. This base pairing is what keeps the two strands together in a stable helical structure.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>RNA as Genetic Material (in some viruses):</strong>
              <p>While DNA is the primary genetic material in most organisms, some viruses use RNA (ribonucleic acid) as their genetic material. RNA is similar to DNA, except it is usually single stranded, and contains ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose, and uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). Examples include HIV and some other viral pathogens. *Na dem be the bad bois of the cellular world o*!
              </p>
           </li>
        <li><strong>Genetic Code:</strong>
                <p>The sequence of bases in DNA (or RNA) is the genetic code that dictates how proteins are made. Every three bases (a codon) codes for an amino acid. It’s like a language written with these four letters (A, T, C, G). The order of these letters determines everything about a living thing.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>How the Genetic Material Works</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>DNA Replication:</strong>
               <p>The DNA molecule can replicate itself through a semi-conservative process. The DNA molecule unwinds, separates into two strands, and each strand is used as a template to synthesize a new complementary strand. *Na dis one be where cell division dey start from*. This ensures that new cells receive accurate copies of the genetic material.</p>

</li>
           <li><strong>Transcription:</strong>
                <p>The genetic information in DNA is copied into a messenger molecule, called mRNA (messenger RNA) by a process called transcription. It’s like using a photocopy machine to make a working copy of the original document. This ensures that DNA does not leave the nucleus, but the message it carries does.</p>
           </li>
           <li><strong>Translation:</strong>
               <p>The mRNA then moves to the ribosomes, where the genetic information is used to synthesize specific proteins. *Na here the real work dey happen*. Transfer RNAs(tRNA) carry specific amino acids, and using the mRNA as a template, the proteins are synthesized. It's like using the blueprint to build the actual house.</p>
            </li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Mutations and Variations</h3>
           <ul>
               <li><strong>Mutations:</strong>
                   <p>Changes in the sequence of DNA can lead to mutations, which can result in variations of traits, sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes neutral. It’s like when you make small errors in a recipe; it can sometimes make the food taste better, worse or nothing changes. Mutations are the driving forces of evolution and genetic variability. It's what makes us all different. So, not everyone is meant to look the same *o*!</p>
               </li>
           </ul>

    <p>So you see, the genetic material, especially DNA, is truly remarkable! It's the very code of life that dictates everything from our hair color to how tall we grow and even how we think. It stores all the information needed to make you who you are, and *e no be small thing o*!</p>

    <p>For the next class, I want you all to research about genetic disorders. Make sure you come prepared with good questions! Thank you all and God bless your learning!</p>

    <h2>Historical Events in Genetics: The Story of How We Discovered Heredity</h2>

        <p>Good morning, my wonderful students! Today, we're going on a journey through time, exploring the key historical events that shaped our understanding of genetics. It’s like telling the story of how we discovered *wetin dey make person be like im papa* or *im mama*. These events are *very, very* important because they laid the groundwork for all the genetics we know today. So, let's settle down and enjoy the story!</p>

        <h3>Early Ideas and Observations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ancient Civilizations:</strong>
                    <p>Even before science as we know it, ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Greeks had some ideas about heredity. They noticed that traits were passed down through generations. You know, how a child might have the nose of their father, or the eyes of their mother. But they had no idea about what was actually responsible for this transfer of traits. They had no clear scientific explanations *o*! They believed it had to do with blood or similar fluids.</p>
             </li>
            <li><strong>Preformationism vs. Epigenesis:</strong>
                    <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, people debated about whether an organism was already fully formed in the sperm or egg (preformationism) or if it developed gradually from scratch (epigenesis). *Na big wahala dem dey argue about dat time*. This debate was critical as it shaped the ideas of the time, but both had serious flaws.</p>
             </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The Birth of Modern Genetics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gregor Mendel and the Laws of Inheritance (Mid-19th Century):</strong>
                   <p>Ah, the one and only, Gregor Mendel! He was an Austrian monk, who studied pea plants and observed their inheritance patterns, and came up with the most important laws in genetics. *Na this man start everything o*. He figured out that traits were passed down in specific units (which we now call genes), and these units could be dominant or recessive. He formulated the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment. His work was published in 1866, but sadly, it was ignored for many years.</p>
                </li>
              <li><strong>Rediscovery of Mendel's Work (Early 20th Century):</strong>

                    <p>Mendel’s work was rediscovered by three different scientists: Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak, working independently of each other around 1900. This was a major turning point! It proved that his ideas were correct, and helped to usher in a new era of genetics. It was like finding a treasure map after so long *o*!</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance</h3>

            <ul>
               <li><strong>Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri (Early 20th Century):</strong>
                  <p>These scientists linked genes with chromosomes, showing that chromosomes were indeed the carriers of genes. They basically said "genes are located on chromosomes", establishing what we know as the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance. This was a critical step, as this explained how genes were inherited from one generation to the other. *Na dem connect all d dots o*!</p>
                </li>
              <li><strong>Thomas Hunt Morgan and Fruit Flies (Early-Mid 20th Century):</strong>
                   <p>Thomas Hunt Morgan, using fruit flies, provided evidence that genes are located at specific places in the chromosome. He also discovered the concept of "sex linked genes", that is some genes are on the sex chromosomes. *Na small fly dem use discover big tin o*! He also discovered "genetic linkage" which is the tendency for genes close to each other on a chromosome to be inherited together.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The Molecular Era of Genetics</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frederick Griffith and the Transforming Principle (1928):</strong>
                   <p>Griffith showed that genetic material could be transferred between bacteria. He conducted an experiment with pneumococcal bacteria, where he noticed that harmless bacteria can become harmful when exposed to a component from dead harmful bacteria. *Na dis discovery shock everyone*. Although he didn't know the identity of this "transforming principle", but this experiment started the process of looking for the real identity of genetic material.</p>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944):</strong>
                   <p>These scientists showed that DNA, not protein, was indeed the transforming principle, in the bacterial transformation experiments. They showed that when they purified the components of the bacterial cell, and used the DNA separately, the transformation still occurred. *Na dis experiment settle the matter*! They finally proved that DNA was the genetic material.</p>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Erwin Chargaff and Base Pairing Rules (Late 1940s-Early 1950s):</strong>
                  <p>Chargaff discovered that the amounts of adenine (A) and thymine (T) were always equal in DNA, and that the amounts of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) were also equal. *Na dis discovery help know how DNA be constructed*. This was a vital clue to the structure of DNA.</p>
             </li>
             <li><strong>James Watson and Francis Crick (1953):</strong>
                  <p>These scientists described the double helix structure of DNA based on Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction images, solving the biggest mystery in Biology *o*! This discovery revolutionized everything! This showed how DNA is structured to store information, replicate, and direct protein synthesis. This was the beginning of modern molecular biology.</p>
              </li>
             </ul>

        <h3>Modern Advances in Genetics</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Human Genome Project (1990-2003):</strong>
                    <p>This massive international project aimed to map out all human genes. It revolutionized our understanding of human health, disease, and our own evolutionary history. *Na big work o*. This project has provided a solid foundation for all further research on human genetics.</p>
             </li>
              <li><strong>Development of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):</strong>
                  <p>PCR is a technique used to make millions of copies of DNA in a very short time, revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics. *Na im make DNA be easy to study*. PCR is one of the most used techniques in modern biology.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing:</strong>
                    <p>This revolutionary technology allows scientists to edit genes with high precision, raising huge ethical questions and opening up new possibilities in treating genetic diseases. This is a relatively new technology, and it continues to evolve. *Na very very big deal o*!</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Significance of These Events</h3>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>Understanding Heredity:</strong>
                    <p>These historical events have helped us to understand how traits are inherited, how we develop from a single cell, and why we are all different. We now know that our genes, located in DNA determine what we become. *Na God hand everything still dey o*!</p>
             </li>
              <li><strong>Medical Advancements:</strong>
                    <p>These have lead to advancements in the treatment of diseases, including the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of genetic disorders. It also opens door to gene therapy for hereditary conditions, and targeted medicines.</p>
            </li>
              <li><strong>Agricultural Improvement:</strong>
                    <p>It has led to improved crop yields through selective breeding and genetic engineering, helping to ensure food security in many parts of the world.</p>
             </li>
           </ul>

        <p>So, my dear students, as you can see, the history of genetics is a rich tapestry of ideas, experiments, and discoveries. This journey of understanding our genetic material continues, and who knows what more we'll uncover in the future? It's a truly exciting time to be learning about genetics!</p>

        <p>For your next class, make sure you read about the "ethical concerns about the advancement in genetics". Come prepared to argue *o*! Thank you all, and may your learning be fruitful!</p>

    <h2>Mendelian Genetics: Unraveling the Secrets of Inheritance</h2>

        <p>Good morning, my sharp and brilliant students! Today, we're going to explore one of the most fundamental concepts in genetics: Mendelian Genetics! This is about how you got the *fine face* of your father, or the *sharp brain* of your mother! It’s all about how traits are inherited, according to the work of our guy, Gregor Mendel. So, *make una listen well well, ehn?*</p>

        <h3>Who Was Gregor Mendel, and Why Should We Care?</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Monk with a Green Thumb:</strong>
                  <p>Gregor Mendel was not your everyday monk. He was an Austrian monk with a knack for science and a passion for gardening. He used his monastery garden to conduct meticulous experiments with pea plants. Can you imagine? Pea plants became the key to unlocking the secrets of heredity, *e no be small thing o*!</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Why Pea Plants?</strong>
                    <p>Mendel chose pea plants because they have several advantageous characteristics:
                        <ul>
                             <li>They grow quickly, so many generations can be studied in a short time.</li>
                             <li>They have several clearly defined traits that come in two distinct forms (e.g., tall or short, purple or white flowers).</li>
                             <li>They can self-pollinate and be cross-pollinated easily, which allows scientists to control the breeding and study genetics.</li>
                             <li>They produce many offspring, so we can be able to get statistical data.</li>
                         </ul>
                      *Na correct choice he make o*! These characteristics made them ideal for studying patterns of inheritance.</p>
              </li>
                <li><strong>Mendel's Approach:</strong>
                    <p>Mendel was meticulous. He carefully controlled his experiments, tracking the inheritance of various traits across many generations. *Na so so accurate recording he dey do*. He kept records of everything, and did the math *well well*, that is the secret of his success.</p>

        <h3>Key Terms You Need to Know</h3>

            <ul>
                 <li><strong>Traits:</strong>

                     <p>These are the observable characteristics of an organism. *Na wetin you fit see with your eyes*, like hair color, eye color, height, and the shape of your nose. They are what make us all unique, different from each other. They are usually controlled by genes.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Genes:</strong>
                    <p>Genes are units of heredity that carry the instructions for a particular trait, like the recipe for *jollof rice*. *Na from here everything dey start*. They are located on chromosomes.</p>
                 </li>
                  <li><strong>Alleles:</strong>
                    <p>Alleles are different versions of a gene. For example, a gene for height might have alleles for tallness or shortness. It's like having different types of yam in the market, one sweeter than the other. Each person has two alleles for each gene. They could be the same, or different. These alleles are responsible for the different types of traits that are displayed by a particular gene.</p>
                  </li>
                 <li><strong>Genotype:</strong>
                       <p>This refers to the actual genetic makeup of an organism, that is, which alleles it carries. For example, an organism might have two alleles for tallness, or one for tallness and one for shortness. *Na wetin dey inside, you no fit see with your eyes*.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Phenotype:</strong>
                      <p>This refers to the observable traits of an organism, what you *fit see with your eyes*. For example, an organism might be tall, short, with brown eyes, or blue eyes, etc. The phenotype is determined by the genotype. *Na wetin dey show outside*.</p>
                </li>
               <li><strong>Homozygous:</strong>
                     <p>When an organism has two identical alleles for a trait. *Na like two twins wey dey look exactly the same*. This means both alleles are either both dominant or both recessive.</p>
              </li>
               <li><strong>Heterozygous:</strong>
                     <p>When an organism has two different alleles for a trait. *Na like two siblings wey no dey look alike*! This means one allele is dominant while the other is recessive.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dominant Allele:</strong>
                    <p>An allele that expresses its trait even when paired with a recessive allele. It's like the *oga* that dominates over others, *na him dey rule*.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Recessive Allele:</strong>
                       <p>An allele that only expresses its trait when paired with another identical recessive allele. It’s like the *shy person* who needs to be with someone similar before they can show themselves. It only shows in the absence of a dominant allele.</p>
                 </li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</h3>

            <ul>
                 <li><strong>The Law of Segregation:</strong>
                     <p>This law states that during the formation of gametes (sperm and eggs), the two alleles for a gene separate from each other. This means that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene, and then when fertilization occurs, the zygote (fertilized egg) gets one allele from each parent for each gene. *Na how we get our genes from our papa and mama*. This ensures that there is a combination of traits in the offspring from both parents.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>The Law of Independent Assortment:</strong>
                    <p>This law states that alleles for different genes assort independently of each other during gamete formation. This means that the allele for hair color has no effect on the allele for height. However, this law only applies if the genes are on different chromosomes or far apart from each other on the same chromosome. *Na why some people get tall and dark skin, and some are short with light skin*. They are independent of each other.</p>
                </li>
             </ul>

        <h3>Using Punnett Squares to Predict Inheritance</h3>

            <ul>
               <li><strong>What is a Punnett Square?</strong>
                      <p>A Punnett square is a simple diagram that we use to predict the possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from a particular mating, like predicting the outcome of a football match. It is used to understand inheritance patterns in different crosses between different individuals.</p>
               </li>
               <li><strong>Monohybrid Cross:</strong>
                     <p>This is when we track the inheritance of a single trait, such as tallness or shortness.
                          <ul>
                                <li>For example, if a tall plant (TT) is crossed with a short plant (tt), the offspring (Tt) will all be tall because the allele for tallness (T) is dominant over the allele for shortness (t). However, if two of these offspring (Tt) are crossed, we get a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 (3 tall, 1 short) in the next generation. This is because each parent passes one allele each to the offspring, leading to three possible genotypes; TT, Tt, and tt. This allows us to understand the genetic makeup of the offspring.</li>
                          </ul>
                     </p>
               </li>
               <li><strong>Dihybrid Cross:</strong>
                      <p>This is when we track the inheritance of two traits simultaneously, like tracking the seed shape (round or wrinkled) and seed color (yellow or green) at the same time.
                            <ul>
                                 <li>For example, if we cross a plant with round and yellow seeds (RRYY) with a plant with wrinkled green seeds (rryy), we will get offspring with round and yellow seeds (RrYy) in the first generation. If two of these offspring are crossed, the offspring in the next generation will have four different phenotypes with a ratio of 9:3:3:1. (9 with round and yellow seeds, 3 with round and green seeds, 3 with wrinkled and yellow seeds, 1 with wrinkled and green seeds) This is because alleles for different traits assort independently from each other.</li>
                           </ul>
                     </p>
                 </li>

           </ul>

        <h3>Beyond Simple Mendelian Genetics</h3>

            <ul>
               <li><strong>Incomplete Dominance:</strong>
                    <p>Sometimes, neither allele is completely dominant, and the phenotype is a blend of both alleles. Like when you mix red paint with white paint, you get pink. This is an exception to simple dominance where the dominant allele takes over completely. *E no dey always so straightforward o*!</p>
                </li>
               <li><strong>Codominance:</strong>
                   <p>In codominance, both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype, not a mixture. Like blood type, where both A and B alleles can be expressed equally, resulting in blood type AB, rather than a mixture of both. *Na two oga at the top dey rule*. They are both expressed at the same time. It is different from incomplete dominance.</p>
                 </li>
               <li><strong>Multiple Alleles:</strong>
                   <p>Some genes have more than two alleles. Blood type, which has three alleles (A, B, and O), is a good example. *No be all traits get only two forms o*! This increases the number of possible genotypes and phenotypes, causing the variation we see in humans.</p>
                 </li>
               <li><strong>Pleiotropy:</strong>
                     <p>A single gene can affect multiple traits. *Na one gene dey cause many different effects*. For example, sickle cell anemia affects not just the shape of red blood cells, but also other aspects of human health. </p>
               </li>
               <li><strong>Polygenic Inheritance:</strong>
                      <p>Multiple genes can control a single trait, like skin color or height, so it is not one gene, but many genes that are interacting to produce the resulting trait. This is why these traits show a wide range of phenotypes in the population. *Na many genes dey work to give a person their unique look*.</p>
                </li>
              <li><strong>Environmental Effects:</strong>
                     <p>The environment can affect how genes are expressed. For example, plants may grow taller when they get enough sunlight and water, even if they are genetically short. So your genes are only part of your story, the environment also influences the final outcome. *No be only genes o*!
                  </p>
              </li>

           </ul>

         <h3>Significance of Mendelian Genetics</h3>

             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Foundation of Genetics:</strong>
                      <p>Mendelian genetics laid the foundation for understanding inheritance, providing the basis for all further genetic research. It is like laying the foundation for a house before building on it.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Predicting Inheritance:</strong>
                        <p>We can use Mendel's laws to predict the likelihood of inheriting specific traits, which is helpful in medicine and agriculture. It helps to understand the chances of passing a trait to the next generation.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Basis for Understanding Genetic Diseases:</strong>
                     <p>Mendelian genetics helps to understand how diseases that are inherited from one generation to the other, occurs and helps in diagnosing and preventing them.</p>
                </li>
             </ul>

        <p>So, my dear students, as you can see, Mendelian Genetics is the bedrock of modern genetics. *E no be play play o!* Mendel’s meticulous work has revolutionized our understanding of how traits are inherited, and we are still building on his discoveries. </p>

        <p>For our next class, we will explore the link between genes and chromosomes. Make sure you read up about it, and come ready to ask sharp questions! Thank you all, and may the genetics be with you! </p>

    <h2>Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology: Manipulating the Code of Life</h2>

        <p>Good morning, my inquisitive students! Today, we are venturing into the realms of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. *E no be small thing o*! This is where we learn to *chop bellefull* with the knowledge we have gathered about genetics, and learn to modify genes to achieve specific goals, and solve various problems facing humanity. So get ready to be amazed!</p>

        <h3>What is Genetic Engineering?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Manipulation of Genes:</strong>
                    <p>Genetic engineering is the process where we directly alter the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of an organism. We are literally going into the code of life and changing it to suit our needs, like adjusting the recipe to get *jollof rice* to be exactly the way we want it. It involves the isolation, modification, and introduction of specific genes into another organism.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Recombinant DNA Technology:</strong>
                    <p>A key part of genetic engineering is recombinant DNA technology. This involves combining DNA from different sources to make a new DNA molecule. *Na like mixing two ingredients together to make something new, and more useful*. This recombinant DNA is then introduced into an organism and the modified trait can be passed down to their offspring.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Key Techniques in Genetic Engineering</h3>

            <ul>
                 <li><strong>Gene Cloning:</strong>
                      <p>This is the process of making multiple copies of a particular gene, like making *plenty copies* of your favorite document. This is useful for when you need a specific gene to be present in large quantities. The copies are genetically identical and can be used for research or various industrial applications. </p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Restriction Enzymes:</strong>
                    <p>These are enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences, acting like molecular scissors. *Na dem dey cut the DNA in the right places*. We can isolate the specific genes we want by using them. They are naturally found in bacteria and used for defence against viral attacks.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>DNA Ligase:</strong>

                    <p>This is an enzyme that joins DNA fragments together, like molecular glue. *Na dis one dey take stick the DNA fragments back together*. This is essential in making recombinant DNA molecules.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Vectors:</strong>
                     <p>Vectors are DNA molecules that carry foreign DNA into a host cell, like a *danfo* transporting passengers to a new location. Plasmids and viruses are often used as vectors in gene cloning, carrying genes into the target cell. Once inside, they cause the introduced genes to be replicated and expressed.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Transformation:</strong>
                     <p>Transformation is the process where host cells take up foreign DNA, like receiving a parcel you ordered online. It is one of the methods used to introduce a specific gene to a new organism.</p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing:</strong>
                      <p>This revolutionary technology allows for precise editing of DNA sequences. This has opened the door to a wide range of applications in research and medicine. *Na very very powerful tool o*. It uses a guide RNA to find and cut a specific DNA sequence, allowing for the insertion, deletion or alteration of genes.</p>
                </li>

             </ul>

         <h3>What is Biotechnology?</h3>
